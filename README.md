# CS 198: Docker/Kubernetes Guest Lecture

This repository contains the files for lecture slides and demos for the
Docker/Kubernetes guest lecture I gave for the Spring 2022 iteration of CS 198
([The Missing Semester DeCal](https://cs198.org/)).

## Setup

To build and run the slides and demo, install Docker and Python. Then, run
`python3 -m venv env && env/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`. Source the
environment by running `source env/bin/activate`.

## Viewing the Slides

Run the slides by running `lookatme --no-ext-warn slides.md` (accept the
extension warnings to continue).
